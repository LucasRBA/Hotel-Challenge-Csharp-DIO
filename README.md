## Project Challenge
In order to complete this challenge you'll have to use tha knowledge acquired by finishing .NET DIO's course.

## Context
You were hired to built a simple system to manage a hotel, and its operations, like register a guest , choose a room,  and calculate the bill to be payed.
Your method to do the checkout needs to apply a 10% discount if the number of booked days is greater than 10, it also needs to verify if the number of guests is equal or less than the room capacity in order to book.

### Pessoa = Person
### Nome = Name
### Sobrenome = Lastname

### Suite = Suite/Room
### Tipo Suite = Room type
### Capacidade = Capacity
### Valor Diaria = Price per night

### Reserva = reservation
### Hospedes = Guests
### Dias reservados = Booked days
### Cadastrar Hospedes = Guest registration
### Cadastrar suite = Get suite type
### Obter quantidade = Display booked guests
### Calcular Valor Diaria = CalculateTotal


### My addtions to the original solution were mostly in order to make the console app like an interactive menu, to receive the user input as parameters and based on them calculate and display the results.
